    // ------------------------------
    // STAKING
    // ------------------------------

    // Overall
    // ------------------------------
    // In order to create a new assertion the validator creating it must be staked. Only one stake
    // is needed per consistent lineage of assertions, so additional stakes must be placed when
    // lineages diverge.
    // As an example, for the following chain only one stake would be locked up in the C assertion
    // A -- B -- C
    // However for the following chain 2 stakes would be locked up, in C and in D
    // A -- B -- C
    //       \-- D
    // Since we know that only one assertion chain can be correct, we only need one stake available
    // to be refunded at any one time, and any more than one stake can be immediately confiscated.
    // So in the above situation although 2 stakes are not available to be withdrawn as they are locked
    // by C and D, only 1 stake needs to remain in the contract since one of the stakes will eventually
    // be confiscated anyway.
    // In practice, what we do here is increase the withdrawable amount of an escrow address that is
    // expected to be controlled by the rollup owner, whenever the lineage forks.

    // Moving stake
    // ------------------------------
    // Since we only need one stake per lineage we can lock the stake of the validator that last extended that
    // lineage. All other stakes within that lineage are then free to be moved to other lineages, or be withdrawn.
    // Additionally, it's inconsistent for a validator to stake on two different lineages, and as a validator
    // should only need to have one stake in the system at any one time.
    // In order to create a new assertion a validator needs to have free stake. Since stake is freed from an assertion
    // when another assertion builds on it, we know that if the assertion that was last staked on by a validator
    // has children, then that validator has free stake. Likewise, if the last staked assertion does not have children
    // but it is the parent of the assertion the validator is trying to create, then we know that by the time the assertion
    // is created it will have children, so we can allow this condition as well.

    // Updating stake amount
    // ------------------------------
    // The stake required to create an assertion can be updated by the rollup owner. A required stake value is stored on each
    // assertion, and shows how much stake is required to create the next assertion. Since we only store the last
    // assertion made by a validator, we don't know if it has previously staked on lower/higher amounts and
    // therefore offer partial withdrawals due to this difference. Instead we enforce that either all of the
    // validators stake is locked, or none of it.
