///         Binary trees
///         --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
///         A complete tree is a balanced binary tree - each node has two children except the leaf
///         Leaves have no children, they are a complete tree of size one
///         Any tree (can be incomplete) can be represented as a collection of complete sub trees.
///         Since the tree is binary only one or zero complete tree at each level is enough to define any size of tree.
///         The root of a tree (incomplete or otherwise) is defined as the cumulative hashing of all of the
///         roots of each of it's complete and empty subtrees.
///         ---------
///         eg. Below a tree of size 3 is represented as the composition of 2 complete subtrees, one of size
///         2 (AB) and one of size one (C).
///            AB
///           /  \
///          A    B    C
///
///         Merkle expansions and roots
///         --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
///         The minimal amount of information we need to keep in order to compute the root of a tree
///         is the roots of each of its sub trees, and the levels of each of those trees
///         A "merkle expansion" (ME) is this information - it is a vector of roots of each complete subtree,
///         the level of the tree being the index in the vector, the subtree root being the value.
///         The root is calculated by hashing each of the levels of the subtree together, adding zero hashes
///         where relevant to make a balanced tree.
///         ---------
///
///         ME Example 1
///
///         C => (C)
///
///         ME of the C tree = (C), root=(C)
///         The merkle expansion of a tree consisting of a single leaf is vector of size one with the
///         zeroth index being the leaf C. The zeroth index of the vector represents the presence of a size
///         one complete subtree in the overall tree. So if a tree has a size one complete subtree as part
///         of its composition, the root of that size one tree will be present in the zeroth index.
///
///         ME Example 2
///
///            AB
///           /  \
///          A    B
///
///         ME of the AB tree = (0, AB), root=AB
///         The merkle expansion of a tree consisting of a single size 2 complete subtree is a vector
///         of size 2, with the zeroth index value being 0, and the 1st index value being the root of the size
///         2 subtree. The zero in the zeroth index indicated that there is not a size 1 subtree in the tree's
///         composition. If a tree has a size 2 subtree in its composition its root will be present in the
///         1st index.
///
///         ME Example 3
///
///            AB
///           /  \
///          A    B    C
///
///         ME of the composed ABC tree = (C, AB), root=hash(AB, hash(C, 0)).
///         When a tree is not itself a complete subtree, but rather a composition, zeros are added when
///         calculating the root. To do this hash the first complete sub tree with zero, and from there
///         cumulatively hash the merkle expansion.
///         The merkle expansion of this composed tree is a vector of size two. Since it has a size one tree in
///         its composition the root of that goes in the zeroth index of the expansion - C, and since it has a
///         size two tree in its composition the root of that goes in the 1st index, to give (C, AB).
///
///         Tree operations
///         --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
///         Binary trees are modified by adding or subtracting complete subtrees, however this library
///         supports additive only trees since we dont have a specific use for subtraction at the moment.
///         We call adding a complete subtree to an existing tree "appending", appending has the following
///         rules:
///         1. Only a complete sub trees can be appended
///         2. Complete sub trees can only be appended at the level of the lowest complete subtree in the tree, or below
///         3. If the existing tree is empty a sub tree can be appended at any level
///         When appending a sub tree we may increase the size of the merkle expansion vector, in the same
///         that adding 1 to a binary number may increase the index of its most significant bit
///         ---------
///         eg. A complete subtree can only be appended to the ABC tree at level 0, since the its lowest complete
///         subtree (C) is at level 0. Doing so would create a complete sub tree at level 1, which would in turn
///         cause the creation of new size 4 sub tree
///
///                                         ABCD
///                                       /     \
